What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
I need to manually add the new file to the repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
It is a temporary area that stores the ready-to-be commited changes. It allows you to flexibly commit what ever files you want.
